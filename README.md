# How to Use

The homepage displays the current list of flashcard decks that are available. The user can use the Create Deck button to add a new deck to the database. 

Once a new deck is added, individual cards can be created by clicking on the deck and then using the Add Card button. 

Each card is described by its front, which is initially presented to the user as a question or prompt, and the back, which has the answer or further information. 

Once a deck is created, the user can study the deck by working through each card, displaying the front, and then flipping to its back. 

# Notes

A deck must have at least 3 cards for the user to study it. Decks composed of 2 cards or fewer are of insufficient size.
